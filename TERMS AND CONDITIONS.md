Welcome to **NotyCaption**, developed by **NotY215**.

By downloading, installing, accessing, or using NotyCaption (including any updates, modifications, or future versions), you agree to be bound by these **Terms and Conditions** ("Terms"). If you do **not** agree with any part of these Terms, you must **not** use the App.

These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and NotY215.  
You must be at least **13 years old** (or the minimum age required in your country to use online services without parental consent) to use the App. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you must have your parent or legal guardian consent to these Terms on your behalf.

## 2. License to Use the App

NotY215 grants you a **limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license** to use NotyCaption for **personal, non-commercial purposes** only, subject to these Terms.

You may **not**:

## 3. Google Login & Online Mode

### 3.1 Google OAuth Authentication
When you choose to log in with Google, the App uses **Google OAuth 2.0** to request access to your Google Drive (read/write permissions for specific folders only).  
We **only** use these permissions to:

- Upload temporary audio files to a private "uploads" folder
- Create and run temporary Google Colab notebooks
- Download generated caption files (.srt / .ass)
- Delete temporary files after successful download (when possible)

We **do not** store your Google credentials, access tokens (beyond what's needed during the session), or read any other files in your Drive.

### 3.2 Online Mode Limitations & Risks
- Caption generation in **Online mode** runs on **Google Colab** — a third-party service.
- We have **no control** over Google Colab availability, speed, quotas, or suspension of free accounts.
- Temporary files are deleted from Drive after download (when the process completes successfully). However, we cannot guarantee 100% deletion in all failure scenarios.
- **You are responsible** for any Google account quota usage, billing (if applicable), or policy violations caused by using Online mode.

---

## 4. Local Processing & Privacy

When using **Normal (local) mode**:

- All audio processing, transcription (using OpenAI Whisper), and subtitle generation happen **entirely on your device**.
- No audio, video, or generated subtitles are sent to any external server unless you explicitly choose Online mode.
- Temporary WAV files created during import/enhancement are stored in your chosen temp directory and should be deleted when you close the app (best-effort basis).

We **do not** collect, store, or transmit:

- Your audio files
- Your generated subtitles
- Any personally identifiable information (except what Google provides during OAuth login if you use Online mode)
